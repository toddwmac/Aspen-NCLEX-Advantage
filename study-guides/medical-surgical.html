        <h2>Medical-Surgical Nursing Essentials for the NCLEX</h2>
        
        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Medical-Surgical Nursing covers the comprehensive care of adult patients with acute and chronic illnesses. This guide strengthens your ability to assess, plan, implement, and evaluate patient care effectively while integrating the latest evidence-based practices.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Core Concepts -->
        <h3>Core Concepts in Medical-Surgical Nursing</h3>
        <h4>1. Patient Assessment</h4>
        <p>
          A thorough assessment forms the foundation of safe patient care. Learn to collect patient histories, perform physical examinations, and interpret diagnostic data to identify critical needs.
        </p>
        
        <h4>2. Understanding Pathophysiology</h4>
        <p>
          Knowledge of disease processes allows you to anticipate complications and plan appropriate interventions. For example, grasping the mechanisms behind heart failure or diabetes improves your ability to manage these conditions.
        </p>
        
        <h4>3. Prioritization of Care</h4>
        <p>
          Effective prioritization ensures that the patient’s most urgent needs are addressed first. Use frameworks like the ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) to guide rapid decision-making.
        </p>
        
        <h4>4. Patient Education</h4>
        <p>
          Educating patients about their condition and treatment plan not only improves outcomes but also promotes self-care. Develop clear, compassionate communication strategies to empower patients.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Key Areas of Focus -->
        <h3>Key Areas of Focus</h3>
        <h4>a. Cardiovascular</h4>
        <p>
          Explore conditions such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. Learn to recognize signs like chest pain and dyspnea while understanding intervention strategies such as medication administration and lifestyle modifications.
        </p>
        
        <h4>b. Respiratory</h4>
        <p>
          Understand respiratory conditions like COPD, pneumonia, and asthma. Master oxygen therapy techniques and the interpretation of vital signs to promptly intervene in respiratory distress.
        </p>
        
        <h4>c. Gastrointestinal &amp; Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
          Identify and manage issues such as GI bleeding and pancreatitis. Integrate nutritional assessment and therapy to improve patient recovery and overall well-being.
        </p>
        
        <h4>d. Endocrine &amp; Metabolic</h4>
        <p>
          Learn about diabetes, thyroid disorders, and electrolyte imbalances. Recognize how hormonal imbalances affect metabolic processes and utilize monitoring tools, such as blood glucose tests.
        </p>
        
        <h4>e. Renal &amp; Urinary</h4>
        <p>
          Address the complexities of acute and chronic kidney diseases by monitoring quantitative markers—such as BUN and creatinine—and applying interventions like fluid management and dialysis protocols.
        </p>
