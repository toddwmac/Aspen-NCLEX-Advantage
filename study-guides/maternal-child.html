        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Maternal-Child Nursing encompasses care from the prenatal period through labor, delivery, and early pediatric care. This guide provides an in-depth exploration of maternal and child health topics, equipping you with the knowledge needed to manage complex clinical scenarios.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Core Concepts -->
        <h3>Core Concepts in Maternal-Child Nursing</h3>
        <h4>1. Prenatal Care and Assessment</h4>
        <p>
          Effective prenatal care involves monitoring both maternal and fetal health. This includes assessing risk factors, conducting regular examinations, and educating expecting mothers about nutrition, prenatal vitamins (like folic acid), and lifestyle adjustments.
        </p>
        
        <h4>2. Labor and Delivery Management</h4>
        <p>
          Knowledge of the stages of labor—early, active, and the transition phase—is critical. Nurses must monitor fetal heart rates, contraction patterns, and maternal vital signs, intervening promptly to ensure a safe delivery process.
        </p>
        
        <h4>3. Postpartum Recovery and Pediatric Care</h4>
        <p>
          Care during the postpartum period includes monitoring for complications such as hemorrhage or infection and assessing maternal emotional well‐being. Pediatric care focuses on growth assessments, immunizations, and parental education regarding infant safety.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Key Areas of Focus -->
        <h3>Key Areas of Focus</h3>
        <h4>a. Maternal Health</h4>
        <p>
          Emphasize the importance of monitoring blood pressure, assessing for signs of preeclampsia, and providing education on nutrition and self-care during pregnancy.
        </p>
        <h4>b. Fetal Monitoring</h4>
        <p>
          Learn techniques for fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasound assessments to track fetal development and ensure early detection of potential complications.
        </p>
        <h4>c. Family-Centered Care</h4>
        <p>
          Involve family members in the care process by providing detailed education on newborn care, safe sleep practices, and establishing healthy routines. This ensures a supportive environment for both mother and child.
        </p>
