        <h3>Core Concepts in Mental Health Nursing</h3>
        <h4>1. Therapeutic Communication</h4>
        <p>
          Building trust is paramount. Master active listening, empathy, and clear communication to form meaningful connections with patients. These skills not only ease patient anxiety but also enhance treatment adherence.

        <h4>2. Comprehensive Patient Assessment</h4>
        <p>
          Evaluate mental status by observing behavior, mood, thought processes, and risk factors such as suicidal ideation. A systematic assessment forms the basis for accurate diagnosis and tailored interventions.
        </p>
        
        <h4>3. Intervention Strategies</h4>
        <p>
          Employ approaches such as cognitive-behavioral techniques, de-escalation methods, and crisis intervention to effectively manage psychiatric emergencies and long-term treatment plans.
