        <h2>NCLEX Overview &amp; Strategies for Success</h2>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The NCLEX is the critical exam that determines if you are ready to practice as a licensed registered nurse. This guide offers a comprehensive overview of the exam’s purpose, formats, and strategies for success. It is designed to build your confidence and to give you a deep understanding of how to approach each question.
        </p>

        <!-- Core Concepts -->
        <h3>Core Concepts in NCLEX Preparation</h3>

        <h4>1. Purpose and Structure of the NCLEX</h4>
        <p>
          The NCLEX assesses whether you have the foundational nursing knowledge and critical thinking skills required for safe patient care. You'll encounter multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and scenario-based questions. Understanding the breadth and scope of the exam helps you tailor your study efforts.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Time Management Strategies</h4>
        <p>
          Efficient use of time during the exam is vital. One method is to divide your total time by the number of questions to form a rough pace. Practice using a timer during your study sessions so you can train yourself to answer methodically without sacrificing accuracy.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Test-Taking Techniques</h4>
        <p>
          Key techniques include reading questions carefully, identifying keywords in clinical scenarios, and using the process-of-elimination method. These skills allow you to reduce the complexity of each question and focus on what truly matters.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Avoiding Common Pitfalls</h4>
        <p>
          Many candidates lose marks by rushing through questions or overthinking details. Learn to recognize when you’re stuck and move on—return later if time allows. Reviewing your answers, if possible, also minimizes careless errors.
        </p>
